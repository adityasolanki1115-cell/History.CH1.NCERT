          <h2>Full chapter text (paraphrased in simple language)</h2>

          <div id="content" class="chapter-text">

            <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
            <div class="para orig" id="p1">
              <strong>1.</strong> In the late 1700s, France was a powerful kingdom ruled by a king. But many common people were unhappy. There were severe taxes, rising food prices, and a big gap between the rich and the poor. These problems, plus new ideas about rights and government, led to a crisis that became the French Revolution.
            </div>
            <div class="para explain" data-for="p1" style="display:none">
              <strong>Explanation:</strong> Imagine a town where a few families own most shops and land while others work hard but pay most of the taxes. When bread becomes expensive and people feel treated unfairly, they get angry. New thinkers (philosophers) said people had rights and should choose their leaders — these ideas made people want change.
            </div>

            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <div class="para orig" id="p2">
              <strong>2.</strong> French society was divided into three groups called the Three Estates: the First Estate (clergy), the Second Estate (nobles) and the Third Estate (commoners which included peasants, urban workers and the emerging middle class). The First and Second had privileges and paid few taxes while the Third bore most of the tax burden.
            </div>
            <div class="para explain" data-for="p2" style="display:none">
              <strong>Explanation:</strong> Think of a school where teachers and some students never follow rules while the rest do all the work. The Third Estate were the majority but had the least power — this unfairness caused anger and demand for fairness.
            </div>

            <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
            <div class="para orig" id="p3">
              <strong>3.</strong> The French monarchy spent a lot of money on wars and luxury, and the state treasury ran out. Attempts to reform taxes failed because the nobility resisted. When King Louis XVI called the Estates-General in 1789 to find a solution, the Third Estate demanded a greater say.
            </div>
            <div class="para explain" data-for="p3" style="display:none">
              <strong>Explanation:</strong> The government was close to bankruptcy. Imagine your parents spending all their saved money on entertainment while bills pile up. When the family meets to decide, the people who pay most taxes want a fair share in the decision.
            </div>

            <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
            <div class="para orig" id="p4">
              <strong>4.</strong> The Third Estate formed the National Assembly claiming to represent the whole nation. Soon after, on 14 July 1789, angry Parisians attacked the Bastille prison — a symbol of royal power. This event became the most famous start of the Revolution.
            </div>
            <div class="para explain" data-for="p4" style="display:none">
              <strong>Explanation:</strong> When a group says "we speak for everyone", this challenges the old system. The storming of the Bastille was like people breaking into a locked building that represented who had power. It inspired others to rise up.
            </div>

            <img class="image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Prise_de_la_Bastille.jpg" alt="Storming of the Bastille" />

            <!-- Paragraph 5 -->
            <div class="para orig" id="p5">
              <strong>5.</strong> The revolution spread quickly. Peasants attacked the houses of local lords, and people demanded rights and new laws. The National Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which said that all men are born free and equal in rights.
            </div>
            <div class="para explain" data-for="p5" style="display:none">
              <strong>Explanation:</strong> The Declaration is like a promise that everyone should be treated fairly — with freedom of speech, equal laws and protection. It was a big change from the old idea that kings had absolute power.
            </div>

            <!-- Paragraph 6 -->
            <div class="para orig" id="p6">
              <strong>6.</strong> Women also took part in protests. They marched to Versailles demanding bread and political change. Over the next years the Revolution went through many stages: from moderate reforms to radical rule by groups that executed the king and many others.
            </div>
            <div class="para explain" data-for="p6" style="display:none">
              <strong>Explanation:</strong> Women in Paris were tired of hunger and wanted leaders to act. Movements can change from peaceful to sudden and harsh when people get desperate — and sometimes leaders use violence to keep or gain control.
            </div>

            <img class="image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Three_estates_cartoon.jpg" alt="Three Estates cartoon" />

            <!-- Paragraph 7 -->
            <div class="para orig" id="p7">
              <strong>7.</strong> The Revolution introduced the idea that the nation, not the king, is the source of power. New laws and institutions replaced feudal privileges. Slavery and colonial issues remained complicated, and the Revolution inspired change across Europe.
            </div>
            <div class="para explain" data-for="p7" style="display:none">
              <strong>Explanation:</strong> Before, power came from the king; after, the people said power comes from the nation. This idea later helped create modern democracies. But changes were not perfect or immediate — many problems stayed and new ones appeared.
            </div>

            <!-- Paragraph 8 -->
            <div class="para orig" id="p8">
              <strong>8.</strong> The French Revolution lasted for a decade and changed politics, society and ideas about government. It had long-term effects — it weakened monarchies and spread demands for representative government.
            </div>
            <div class="para explain" data-for="p8" style="display:none">
              <strong>Explanation:</strong> Even if the Revolution had violence and confusion, it changed how people thought. People began to expect that rulers should be chosen or held accountable — not rule by birthright alone.
            </div>

            <!-- Paragraph 9: Summary line-by-line style -->
            <div class="para orig" id="p9">
